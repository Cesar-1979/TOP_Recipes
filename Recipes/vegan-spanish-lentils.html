        <p>This lentil stew has two secrets that make it stand out from any lentil-based dish you've had: soyrizo and a chunky but smooth texture.</p>
        <p> It is perfect for cozy autumn nights, and you make mealprep a lot of it very easily!</p>

        <ul>Ingredients</ul>
            <li>300 gr lentils</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper (cut in half)</li>
            <li>4 carrots (peeled)</li>
            <li>1 large onion (cut in half)</li>
            <li>1 leek (cut in half)</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 soy chorizo or vegan sausage</li>
            <li>2 tsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tbsp paprika</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>

        <ol>Steps</ol>
            <li>Rinse the lentils and put them into a deep cooking pot.</li>
            <li>Peel the vegetables and the garlic cloves, and throw them in the pot.</li>
            <li>Add water slightly above the level of the vegetables in the pot.</li>
            <li>Heat the stove on medium, cover the pot, and let it bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>When it's boiling, turn down to low heat. Keep an eye on the lentils and add more water if needed.</li>
            <li>Let it cook on low heat for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>After this, the lentils should be cooked. We'll now take all the vegetables and any visible pieces of the soy chorizo and put them into a blender or a deep bowl.</li>
            <li>We'll use an immersion blender to blend everything together. This will give it a creamy texture. You can decide if you want it chunky or completely smooth. I personally like leaving in there some small pieces for texture.</li>
            <li>Then bring the blended veggies back into the pan with the lentils and mix all together.</li>
            <li>A game changer step for platting: Cut a cooked vegan sausage in big pieces and add it on top of the lentils.</li>

            <p>Get ready to eat one of the heartiest dishes you've ever had. The two secrets to this dish are blending all the vegetables using a immersion blender, and adding the pieces of sausage when platting.</p>
            <p>Enjoy!</p>
