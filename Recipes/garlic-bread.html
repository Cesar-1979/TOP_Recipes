    <h3>At first I talked about this dish as a fantastic side for pastas and salads. But who am I kidding, I've eaten a platterful in one afternoon as a snack. What is the secret to making it unforgettable? <strong>Use fresh garlic!</strong> Do not use garlic powder.</h3>

    <ul>Ingredients</ul>
        <li>50 gr unsalted butter (softened)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>One pinch of salt</li>
        <li>One loaf of brioche bread</li>

    <ol>Steps</ol>
        <li>Leave the butter out for approximately 30 minutes before starting. This will make it more malleable and will melt into the bread more easily.</li>
        <li>Chop the parsley very finely.</li>
        <li>Peel the garlic and mince it. Feel free to use a garlic press.</li>
        <li>Add the butter, chopped parsley, and minced garlic into a small mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of salt, and mix everything together.</li>
        <li>Slice the bread into thick sticks.</li>
        <li>Spread the butter on <strong>all four sides</strong> of each piece of bread.</li>
        <li>Toast the bread on a large pan on low heat.</li>
        <li>Flip on each side until golden. Make sure not to let it toast too much. You want it to remain chewy and moist.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>

    <p>These breadsticks are addictive. I think some of the most memorable meals I've had had included this garlic bread and our staple <a href=./vegan-orzo-shillet.html>Vegan Orzo Shillet</a> or our <a href=./vegan-spanish-lentils.html>Vegan Spanish Lentils.</a></p>
    <p>But as I said, I'm not ashamed to admit I've had a full plate of this in one sitting!</p>
